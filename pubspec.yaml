# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MontSerrat
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
    - family: Bangers
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/Bangers-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
    - family: CourierPrime
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/CourierPrime-Regular.ttf
